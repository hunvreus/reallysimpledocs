## Why ReallySimpleDocs?

There are plenty of existing solutions to create documentation websites: Mintlify, Fumadocs, Docusaurus, MkDocs... So why create another one?

I wanted something that was fast, modern, simple, and good-looking. In particular, I did not want any React.

So I built ReallySimpleDocs with [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and [Basecoat](https://basecoatui.com) (Tailwind-based). You get vanilla HTML and CSS, with a tiny bit of JS. And it uses the same design system as shadcn/ui.

## Key features

- **Fast**: 11ty is one of the fastest site generators, usually only second to Hugo.
- **Standard and Reliable**: It's all vanilla CSS, JS and HTML. No complex frameworks with hydration errors. 
- **Git-based with a user-friendly CMS**: All of your content lives in a GitHub repo. And if you need a user-friendly interface for your teammates to edit the content, just use [Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org).
- **Markdown + Nunjucks**: Simple Markdown YAML frontmatter, with the convenience of Nunjucks templating if you need more advance features (e.g. loading Lucide icons).
- **LLM-friendly**: Auto-generated `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, and per-page `/*.md` exports for LLMs.
- **100% free and open source**: I have nothing to sell. No hosting plan, no advanced features. You can host it for free on Cloudflare Pages.

## How can I help?

ReallySimpleDocs is 100% open source and free.
